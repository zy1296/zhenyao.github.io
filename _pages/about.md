I am a Ph.D. student at [Wins Lab](http://carina.cse.lehigh.edu/winslab/index.php), Lehigh University, which I joined in February 2021. My advisor is Dr. Mooi Choo Chuah. My research focuses on Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Autonomous Driving.

Before starting my Ph.D. studies, I obtained my Master's degree from New York University and Bachelor's degree from China Agricultural University.
